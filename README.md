NOTE: Please follow the below instructions:

The module should be developed in pure python, no frameworks should be used.
The module can have other python libraries to make it work, but those libraries references should be present in the requirements file along with the code. 
The module can be developed with OOPs or a functional programming approach.
The module must have unit test cases written with pytest and they need to have at least 85% code coverage.
There should be code documentation present for each function and file used.
There needs to be a README file documenting the details about the module, installation, and running guidelines.
The module should be installable in a virtual environment, so there should be a way to generate a wheel file.
